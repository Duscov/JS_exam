# Student Quiz Application

This is a simple student quiz application that allows students to take a quiz by answering a series of questions. The project is primarily in Russian, but the setup and instructions are provided in English.

## Project Overview

The application asks the student for their name and group, then presents a series of questions one at a time. The student can either answer the question and confirm their response, or skip the question, in which case it will appear again at the end of the quiz. After completing the quiz, the student is shown a summary of their performance, including the number of correct answers, their name, and group.

### Key Features:
- The student enters their name and group to start.
- Questions appear one by one.
- After answering each question, the student immediately sees if the answer was correct.
- Skipped questions will reappear at the end of the quiz.
- Upon completing the quiz, the student's name, group, and the number of correct answers are displayed.
- The student must take a screenshot of the results and send it to the instructor.
